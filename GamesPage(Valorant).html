	    <h2>THE GAME</h2>
            <p>Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by Riot Games. It features a unique blend of gunplay and strategic team-based gameplay. Players choose characters known as "Agents," each with special abilities that can be used strategically during matches.There are two sides: The Defender and Attacker where each team will play and changes side after 12 rounds. The Attacker needs to plant The Spike in the respective bomb sites and protect it until it explodes. Meanwhile The Defender side has to prevent The Attacker from planting The Spike or defuse The Spike before it explodes. The first team to win 13 rounds wins the game!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
